# M220-Python-For-Developers


Built the back-end for a movie-browsing application called MFlix.

Using the Pymongo driver for Python, I implemented MFlix's basic functionality. This includes basic and complex movie searches, registering new users, and posting comments on the site.

I also added more features to the MFlix application. This includes writing analytical reports, increasing the durability of MFlix's connection with MongoDB, and implementing security best practices.
